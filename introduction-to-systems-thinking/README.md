# Introductions to Systems Thinking

## Parts of a System

* **Purpose**   
  Why does the system exist and what is it trying to achieve?
* **Relationships**   
  How the connections between the elements of the system are shaped and how they influence each other?
* **Elements**  
  Everything the system is made out of, in organisations these are the people.

We need to understand the levers for change that are available to us
in a system and that changing elements is, often, less efficient than
changing relationships or even the purpose.

## System Behaviour over Time

* Stocks   
  Anything that can be counted or measured
* Flows  
  Anything that changes the amount of stock
* Feedback Loops  
  Mechanisms where changes in a stock lead to changes in the flows that affect the stock.

# Examples

### Hire More Developers

Stock: Backlog  
Inflow: 10 tickets/week  
Outflow: 5 tickets/week  
Conditions: Project is already running late 

Solution?  
Hire more developers

**Issues:** 
 * Increased coordination effort
 * Tasks which are not parallelisable
 * Onboarding new developers takes time away from existing developers
 
 Brooks Law - Adding more developers to a late project makes it later.

### Changes in Bonus Schema

Stock: Employee Satisfaction  
Inflow: ???  
Outflow: ???  

Company previously had bonus scheme where employees get a 10-15% bonus based on company profits.  
Company didn't hit targets one year and employees were unhappy because "they worked very hard".

Solution?  
Company makes 50% of bonus dependent on personal performance, rest on profits.

**Issues:**  
 * Employees might prioritise personal performance over company performance
 * [Same issues as next sections]

### Personal Performance Reviews

Stock: Employee Satisfaction (Maybe)  
Inflow: ???  
Outflow: ???  

Company does yearly performance reviews where employees are rated on a scale of 1-5.

Issues:  
 * Employees game the system
 * Employees might not be honest with themselves
 * Employees might not be honest with their managers
 * Employees might not raise issues because they are afraid of negative feedback
 * Employees are rated but can't rate their managers or anyone else "up the chain".
